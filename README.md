#Monika Kazuła - My first page

![Monika](images/Monika.jpg)
 The page "About Me" was created as one of the first my independent work, created for training - YouCode. You can only see the basics in it and still little knowledge on programming.
 However, at that moment, I was proud of myself, that I managed to create something myself.
 ## What am i doing here?
 I am here for it, to stay a front end developer and constantly educate myself in this direction. It is my passion, something I like . Own development and constant acquisition of new skills, they are my goal in life. I also like working with people,therefore I will be satisfied being able to create projects with others in the future.
 ## Languages
 HTML,
 CSS.
 JS.
